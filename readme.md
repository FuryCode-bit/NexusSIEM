<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Project Screenshot][project-screenshot]

NexusSIEM is a Python-based security information analysis engine designed to detect network compromises. Developed as a practical project for the Network Security course at the University of Aveiro, it moves beyond simple signature-based detection to identify threats based on their behavior.

By establishing a quantitative baseline of normal network activity, the engine analyzes anomalous traffic logs to uncover a wide range of threats, including:
*   Internal lateral movement and network scanning.
*   Large-scale data exfiltration over encrypted channels (HTTPS).
*   Command & Control (C&C) communication via DNS and HTTPS beaconing.
*   Coordinated external botnet attacks, such as credential stuffing and DDOS campaigns.

The core of the project is a custom SIEM analysis library (`analysis.py`) and a Jupyter Notebook (`report.ipynb`) that uses this library to generate a comprehensive security report.

<!-- BUILT WITH -->

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/FuryCode-bit/NexusSIEM.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory
    ```sh
    cd NexusSIEM
    ```
3.  Install Python packages
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Download the datasets and the GeoLite2-Country database and place them in the `datasets/` directory as configured in `report.ipynb`.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The primary entry point for this project is the `report.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

1.  **Configure Paths**: Open `report.ipynb` and update the file paths for the baseline, anomalous, and server datasets to match your local setup.
    ```python
    BASELINE_PATH = 'datasets/dataset10/data10.parquet'
    ANOMALOUS_PATH = 'datasets/dataset10/test10.parquet'
    SERVERS_PATH = 'datasets/dataset10/servers10.parquet'
    GEOIP_DB_PATH = 'datasets/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb'
    ```
2.  **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially. The script will load the data, run the full analysis pipeline using the `UltimateSIEM` class, and generate a detailed report complete with markdown explanations and visualizations.

The notebook is designed to be a self-contained security brief, walking through the investigation from initial profiling to the final correlation of threats.

<!-- DETECTION METHODOLOGY -->
## Detection Methodology

The engine employs a rule-based system that scores devices based on the severity and combination of detected malicious behaviors. Key detection rules include:

#### Internal Threats:
*   **Data Exfiltration**: Flags hosts uploading anomalously large volumes of data over HTTPS, with scores scaling based on the amount of data stolen.
*   **C&C Beaconing**: Detects rhythmic, machine-like connections to external servers by analyzing the standard deviation of connection time intervals.
*   **Lateral Movement**: Identifies hosts initiating connections to a significant number of new internal devices not seen in the baseline.
*   **Anomalous Destinations**: Alerts on communications to new or high-risk geopolitical regions (e.g., RU, IR, CN) based on a tiered threat model.

#### External Threats:
*   **Connection Flooding**: Detects brute-force or DDoS attempts by flagging external IPs with an excessively high connection count.
*   **Automated Bot Activity**: Identifies bots through their 24/7 operational patterns and highly periodic, non-human connection timing.

A **Critical Combo Multiplier** is applied to hosts exhibiting multiple high-risk behaviors (e.g., scanning and exfiltrating data), ensuring that the most dangerous threats are prioritized.
